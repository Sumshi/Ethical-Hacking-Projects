1) Install Firewall
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ufw
2) Enable the firewall: sudo ufw enable
3) Check the status of the firewall: sudo ufw status
┌──(kali㉿Kali)-[~]
└─$ sudo ufw status
[sudo] password for kali: 
Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
22/tcp                     ALLOW       Anywhere                  
22/tcp (v6)                ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)  

4) Deny incoming traffic
To improve security, I set the default policy for incoming connections to be denied, except for those explicitly allowed
┌──(kali㉿Kali)-[~]
└─$ sudo ufw default deny incoming
Default incoming policy changed to 'deny'
(be sure to update your rules accordingly)

┌──(kali㉿Kali)-[~]

5)
This setup strengthens the system’s security by enforcing strict rules for network traffic:

Default deny rule minimizes exposure to attacks by blocking all unwanted traffic.
Allow specific ports ensures that only necessary services are accessible while keeping the rest of the system secure.
